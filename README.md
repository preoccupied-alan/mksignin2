# mksignin2

# This project contains a simple website that handles signups for Mama  Kin's open mic night

Performers will land on index.html and be prompted for a password. Given a correct password, they will be prompted to enter their name and select a sign up slot.
An administrative panel will allow the MC to view the list, adjust the password, and modify the sign up list. The admin panel also includes functionality to toggle the list between the traditional signup mode and a randomized draw. Logic for late additions tbd.

Performers will also have access to view the current state of the list via a member page.

The password is a 4-digit int generated by python script on a set time interval. Upon generation, the script is saved to a local txt file, displayed on a 7 pin display connected via GPIO and retrieved by the web app via AJAX request. on an interval at 1/2 the frequency of the regeneration interval.
